# SpotifyRecommendations
This is my first project using Go that uses Spotify's WebAPI to access top artists and tracks of someone's profile. The final idea is to combine it with a Ticketmaster scrapper that will recommend / alert the user of concerts they may be interested in.

Commands:
go mod init SpotifyRecommendations
go build
.\SpotifyRecommendations.exe
